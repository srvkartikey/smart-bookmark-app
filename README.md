## 🗂 Database Design

Table: `bookmarks`

| Column      | Type        |
|------------|------------|
| id         | uuid (PK)  |
| user_id    | uuid (FK)  |
| title      | text       |
| url        | text       |
| created_at | timestamp  |

Row Level Security (RLS) enabled.

Policies ensure:

- Users can only read their own bookmarks
- Users can only insert their own bookmarks
- Users can only delete their own bookmarks

## 🔥 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1️⃣ Google OAuth Configuration

**Problem:**  
Setting up Google OAuth with Supabase and Vercel required correct redirect URLs and environment configuration.

**Solution:**  
- Configured Google Cloud OAuth credentials
- Added Supabase Auth callback URLs
- Set Vercel production URLs properly
- Verified redirect URI consistency

---

### 2️⃣ Private Bookmarks Per User

**Problem:**  
Ensuring User A cannot access User B’s bookmarks.

**Solution:**  
- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS)
- Created policies using `auth.uid() = user_id`
- Filtered queries using session user ID

---

### 3️⃣ Real-Time Updates Across Tabs

**Problem:**  
Bookmark list needed to update automatically without page refresh.

**Solution:**  
- Used Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Subscribed to INSERT and DELETE events
- Updated UI state dynamically when events triggered

---

### 4️⃣ Secure Access Control

**Problem:**  
Preventing unauthorized access to protected pages.

**Solution:**  
- Checked Supabase session on load
- Redirected unauthenticated users to login
- Used middleware protection where required

---

### 5️⃣ Environment Variable Handling in Production

**Problem:**  
App worked locally but failed after deployment.

**Solution:**  
- Added environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Used `.env.local` for development
- Verified Supabase keys were properly set
